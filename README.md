# Deep Neural Networks for Non Linear Classification Tasks
Assignments for the second part of the "Laboratory of Computational Physics" course of the Physics of Data Master's degree. 


When it comes to complicated non-linear classification tasks, Deep neural networks have been
shown to be a very viable and efficient option; however proper care must be taken in selecting the
structure of the model, i.e. its hyper-parameters. The goal of this paper is to study the performance
of the model proposed during the lectures and find a better model which performs sufficiently well
on datasets generated by different non-linear functions.
